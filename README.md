# Face-Masks-during-High-Intensity-Exercise
Welcome to William Wilkins' IIB Project Github repository. This repository contains the files and data which were used to plot the figures and make tables in my final report. This repository contains:

- The raw unconverted experimental time-series data obtained during the experiment's rest and exercise recovery periods.
- The CSV files (converted from the original format) of the raw time-series data from the experiments, which are readable in python.
- The python code used to produce plots of the recorded heart rate time series data and Zakynthinaki's model of heart rate kinetics (2015) which was fitted to the experimental data using the grid search optimisation to extract an optimal lamda, an indicator of the cardiovascular condition of an individual. Due to time constraints the author was not able to finish analysing the time series heart rate data for the other participants, or publish the raw data files here, since plans to publish the original files for participants 1 and 2 in the near future.
- The excel files containing the logbook data for the exercises, as well as the analysis of this data and the cardiovascular condition parameters extracted by the optimisation process. From these, graphs comparing the masks were plotted.

If you have any questions about the files here, please feel free to contact me at wigw2@cam.ac.uk.
